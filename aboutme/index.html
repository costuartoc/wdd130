    <p>Some things about me, I come from a rather large family. I have 10 siblings of which I am the 9th. As a natural extension to that reality I also find myself with 25 nephews and nieces, family gatherings can get a little out of hand.</p>
    <p>I'm an avid reader, primarily fantasy but I dabble in other genres often enough. I also enjoy a good run now and again and there was a stint in which I was able to go rock climbing regularly. Due to the nature of my current schedule I can't get out to the gym much anymore but my love of bouldering still remains.</p> 
    <p>So that's a brief summation of some of the things that make me tick. Thanks for getting to know me! </p>
