                    <h2>SM YSA Sunday School Goals</h2>
                    <p>Our goal as Sunday School instructors is to allow members of the South Mountain YSA ward the opportunity to strengthen and share their testimonies and conversion. We want to create an uplifting environment where members and visitors can ask questions, share experiences and learn from one another as we study together. We want members to receive insight and instruction that will better their lives on a daily basis. In addition to the aforementioned goals we also want to help members develop study habits that will be sustainable and uplifting, allowing them to have the tools to learn on their own. Our ultimate goal is to have discussions led by the Spirit and members who enjoy its constant companionship.</p>

                    <h2>Member Participation</h2>
                    <p>As stated in our goals we’d like to create an uplifting environment. This goal is one that the instructors and members can only accomplish together with the help of the Spirit. We ask all members to do what they can to prepare outside of class so they can share what they’ve learned in their personal studies. In class we’d like everyone to feel comfortable to both answer and ask questions in addition to encouraging others to do so. This encouragement includes showing appreciation when others ask questions you find helpful or provide insights that help you learn. We want members to not just interact with the teacher but to form connections with one another as we learn together.</p>
