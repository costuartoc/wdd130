      <h3>Study Resources</h3>
      <p>
        This year’s book of scripture to study: The New Testament

	      This year we will be studying The New Testament. This book of scripture “is a record of the life, teachings, and mission of Jesus Christ and the ministry of His disciples in promoting the spread of the early Christian Church”.   As we study this year I invite you to pay particularly close attention to what this record teached us of the Savior. The New Testament also teaches us about discipleship. What can we learn as we study the lives of the apostles and others who chose to follow the Savior during his life and after his death and resurrection? In John 17:3 it teaches “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent”. As we study The New Testament this year it will offer us the chance to receive the blessing recorded in John 17.

      </p>
      <p>
        Using Come Follow Me:

	      As we study The New Testament one of the primary resources we have to help guide and inspire us is the 2023 Come Follow Me manual. Each week we will have an additional set of scriptures to study in detail and the Come Follow Me manual can help us identify different lessons and instruction The New testament has to offer. By using this resources as you read through The New Testament you will be strengthened and uplifted in your personal study and come more prepared to feel the Spirit and participate in Sunday School lessons. The more you put into your personal study the more you will be able to benefit and help others as you attend Sunday School.

      <h3>Goals and Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        SM YSA Sunday School goals:
	      Our goal as Sunday School instructors is to allow members of the South Mountain YSA ward the opportunity to strengthen and share their testimonies and conversion. We want to create an uplifting environment where members and visitors can ask questions, share experiences and learn from one another as we study together. We want members to receive insight and instruction that will better their lives on a daily basis. In addition to the aforementioned goals we also want to help members develop study habits that will be sustainable and uplifting, allowing them to have the tools to learn on their own. Our ultimate goal is to have discussions led by the Spirit and members who enjoy its constant companionship.

      </p>
      <p>
        Member Participation:
	      As stated in our goals we’d like to create an uplifting environment. This goal is one that the instructors and members can only accomplish together with the help of the Spirit. We ask all members to do what they can to prepare outside of class so they can share what they’ve learned in their personal studies. In class we’d like everyone to feel comfortable to both answer and ask questions in addition to encouraging others to do so.  This encouragement includes showing appreciation when others ask questions you find helpful or provide insights that help you learn. We want members to not just interact with the teacher but to form connections with one another as we learn together.
