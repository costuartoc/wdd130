                <h2 class="resources-h2">New Testament</h2>
                <p class="resources-p">This year we will be studying The New Testament. This book of scripture “is a record of the life, teachings, and mission of Jesus Christ and the ministry of His disciples in promoting the spread of the early Christian Church”. As we study this year I invite you to pay particularly close attention to what this record teaches us of the Savior. The New Testament also teaches us about discipleship. What can we learn as we study the lives of the apostles and others who chose to follow the Savior during his life and after his death and resurrection? In John 17:3 it teaches “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent”. As we study The New Testament we will havet he chance to receive the blessing recorded in John 17.</p>

                <p class="resources-p">As we study The New Testament one of the primary resources we have to help guide and inspire us is the 2023 Come Follow Me manual. Each week we will have an additional set of scriptures to study and Come Follow Me can help us identify different lessons and instruction The New testament has to offer. By using this resource as you read through The New Testament you will be strengthened and uplifted in your personal study, come more prepared to feel the Spirit and participation in Sunday School lessons will become more natural. The more you put into your personal study the more you will be able to benefit and help others as you attend Sunday School.</p>
